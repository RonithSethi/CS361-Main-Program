            </h1>
            <p class="nutrient-info">
                Fats are the most dense source of energy in our diet and play important metabolic roles in most living things. Most fats can actually be synthesized from the human body itself, save for alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid (omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids). These fats are considered the essential fatty acids. Source: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/

                Carbohydrates
            </h1>
            <p class="nutrient-info">
                Carbohydrates are the main source of energy within the body, and include sugars, starch, and cellulose. The lack of consumption of this macronutrient is known as the ketogenic diet (keto) and was originally prescribed to control epilepsy, but has gained popularity as a fad diet with varying effects.

                Protein
            </h1>
            <p class="nutrient-info">
                Proteins are collections of amino acids and are responsible for facilitating DNA replication which is an essential function of all living organisms. Protein has been popularized as the key behind muscle-building, and has therefore found a home in the hearts of many gym-goers. However, a less-known effect of protein is its potent satiation effect which surpasses the other two macronutrients. In the case of someone trying to lose weight, going on a higher-protein diet may be more fruitful (no pun intended!) than going on a fad diet. Not medical advice though, just information from an undergrad. Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268005X1630340X
